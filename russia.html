                    the prison system in
                    Russia. Is this
                    system effective? What is better rehabilitation or punishment? Today we will try to analyze these
                    and other features of the prison system in Russia.</p>

                    commit suicide in Russian prison.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown"><em>"The softest one could count on was the
                        beating. Moreover, they tried to beat the genitals to
                        deliver
                        maximum suffering. In the sixth colony, they were shocked by attaching bare wires to the limbs,
                        while
                        the hands hung the person on the bars that separated the main cell of the punishment cell from
                        the
                        front
                        door. I hung like that for 18 hours."</em></p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown" style="color: rgb(80, 80, 80);"> - The story of the
                    prisoner Ruslan Lapytov to the journalist.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown">Beatings and other abuse of prisoners, according to
                    Ruslan, were usual practice. Anything could be
                    the
                    reason for torture, be it a minor violation of the regime, a refusal to give money, or a complaint
                    about
                    detention conditions.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown">In addition to physical suffering, inmates in
                    Russian prisons also experienced psychological
                    pressure.
                    The prison guards turn on a musical composition or cartoon songs at full volume and play it
                    continuously
                    all day.
                    After years of such bullying and torture, it is unlikely that a person will live everyday life and
                    become part of society again.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown"><b>Diseases </b>- most prisoners Have diseases</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown">that will lead to death if medical care is not
                    provided. If
                    they
                    were free, they could have cured themselves, but in a Russian prison it is almost impossible.
                    Sometimes
                    these people are convicted for some nonsense (for example, threw a plastic Cup at a police officer).
                    And
                    as often happens: the administration of the correctional colony presents the convicted person to the
                    court for release due to illness. But the court refuses. A month passes, another, a third, and the
                    person dies.

                                regular society.</b></p>
                        <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown">There are three ways in which women can
                            adapt to society after being incarcerated. The first
                            is
                            typical for women who have almost no support. Once released, the stereotype always haunts
                            them
                            that
                            either losers or dangerous people go to prison. They try to hide their past, and therefore
                            always
                            move from one low-paid job to another. They are withdrawn and have difficulty making new
                            acquaintances.¬†</p>

                        <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown"> they are helped by family and friends (for
                            example, to take them to work), they adapt much
                            faster
                            and return to everyday life. But in the event of a crisis (job loss, health problems, or
                            family
                            conflict), they can quickly return to prison.</p>

                        <p class="wow animate__animated animate__zoomInDown"> the second option, women are not afraid to
                            admit to a criminal record. They take advantage
                            of
                            their prison experience and begin to practice law, human rights, and social activities. But
                            this
                            happens very rarely.
                            The third way is the most dangerous for former prisoners. It is faced by women who are left
                            without
                            a family or any support. If these women find themselves without the help of social services,
                            they
                            are quickly left without a place to live, go into sex work, or go back to prison.</p>

                    therefore think twice before breaking the law.
