            <p class="lead"> After we analyzed the prison systems of different countries with different conditions for
                keeping criminals, we came to the conclusion that if criminals are treated like animals (for example, as
                in
                Russia), then after they enter society, they will no longer be able to become a part of it. Therefore
                they
                do everything possible not to go to jail. Accordingly, in countries with a prison system of punishment,
                people try not to commit crimes, but this method is inhuman and, as statistics show, it does not work
                very
                well.<br>
                We believe that the rehabilitation prison system is much more effective and, in general, better, as it
                helps
                criminals understand their mistakes and then return to society. As a rule, people who were in such
                prisons
                no longer commit crimes because they have acquired their values ​​for which they spend all their time
                and
                energy (work or family)</p>
