            <h1>Spanish prison system</h1>

            <p> Spanish prison system is a system of
                scientific individualization made up of three degrees of
                classification and conditional release, which is defined in our prison regulations as fourth degree.
                It is a more evolved system than progressive systems and, theoretically, enjoys greater flexibility
                than these and is governed by subjective criteria and personal evolution rather than by rigid and
                objective criteria, such as the old progressive systems.</p>

            <p><b>Difference between other countries</b>
            </p>

            <p>In Spain there is no death penalty,
                something that in some places of the United States there is.</p>

            <p><b>
                    Typology of establishments and prison administration services in Spain.</b>
            </p>

            <p>The prisons are architecturally designed as
                an independent urban nucleus, which allows internal
                separation and prison classification of the population it houses. Prison professionals carry out
                their work there, guarantee, in turn, the security and custody of the detainees. Currently, we can
                distinguish different types of centers depending on the Ministry of the Interior through the General
                Secretariat of penitentiary establishments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Penitentiary centers, for the execution of sentences, security measures and preventive prisons.
                    They
                    are regularly under the ordinary regime, although they also exist under the</li>

                <li>Social integration centers (hereinafter, CIS), intended to serve sentences under open conditions
                    and
                    monitor probation</li>

                <li>External units for mothers, for women who are serving a sentence with their children under 3
                    years
                    of age. Designed with the aim that minors live in an environment different from the one
                    represented
                    by the prison and thus promote their education.

                <li>Penitentiary psychiatric centers, dedicated to the custody and treatment of persons detained by
                    decision of the courts of justice.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2 class="q wow animate__animated animate__headShake">Pros:</h2>
                <p>
                    In all Spanish prisons it is totally forbidden to receive food from family or friends and if
                    this is
                    the
                    case before delivering it they must be checked by those in the center.
                    There is no death penalty.
                    The rooms do not seem as bad as in other places, they tend to appear of good quality.
                    They keep them entertained by doing work or playing sports.</p>
                <h2>Cons:</h2>
                <p>In Spain the treatment of prisoners is not good at all, many complaints have been made to change
                    the
                    way
                    they treat inmates.
                    Spain, above the European average in number of prisoners and time spent in jail.
                    The changing rooms and bathrooms in the jail are of very poor quality.</p>
