                        Norway. Overall,
                        Norway
                        has
                        seen a significant decline in crime in recent
                        years. In
                        the period from 2015 to 2016, there was a decrease of 4.3 percent, and compared with 2014 - by
                        9.6
                        percent.
                        Considering the growth of the population, this level of registered offenses will be the lowest
                        in 24
                        years
                        of statistics.<br>
                        In 2018, the homicide rate in Norway was 0.53
                        per
                        100,000 population. In 2018, there were 25 murders
                        in
                        Norway. Crime in Norway - <a href="https://ru.qaz.wiki">https://ru.qaz.wiki/</a></p> <br>

                <div class="text-2 row">
                    <p class=" wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight col-6">
                        In Norway, there are 188 police
                        officers per
                        100,000
                        people.<br>

                        According to the statistics of ONU, the
                        average
                        rate
                        of the police to the population in the world is
                        300
                        police per 100,000 people. Thus, in Norway this rate is almost two times lower. In Russia 550
                        police, in
                        USA
                        ‚Äì 243 police. <br>

                        What do they do in Norway to meet these low
                        rates
                        and
                        to provide that only 20% of offender after
                        leaving
                        the
                        prison return to break laws when in USA they are 80% and in Russia more than 90%?<br>

                        The most important thing about the criminal
                        justice system is so efficient is that it has a human
                        character
                        and is built on respect for a person, helping him in rehabilitation and finding his place in
                        society.
                        Most
                        prisoners have a chance to study, have access to the library, classed of foreign languages and
                        professional
                        educations and can even prepare and enter a university. Most of them leave the prison with many
                        new
                        skills
                        and knowledge which help them to find a new place in the society which will give them a new
                        chance.

                </div>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight"> Since most of crimes are petty theft and
                    hooliganism influenced by alcohol or any other spirit,
                    simple
                    mistakes, which should be obviously controlled and punished but always basing on an efficient
                    rehabilitation
                    system like it is done in Norway. A teenager picking food in supermarket will be caught and
                    punished
                    but
                    it
                    cannot be a severe punishment which reject him a chance for another life.</p> <br>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight"> The poverty and need go close to the crime
                    Norway
                    is a wealthy county with a high incomes and very
                    good
                    social programs for those people whose income is not so high. In poor countries, like Brazil and
                    Russia,
                    the
                    crime rate of thefts and robberies is quite higher.</p> <br>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight"> But in in the Norwegian society there can be
                    crimes which, to my point of view, should be treated by
                    separating a person from the society for many years. 22 July 2011 Norway was chocked by a
                    terroristic
                    attack
                    realized by Anders Breivik, a Norwegian radical activist struggling again Muslim emigrants to
                    Norway. He
                    killed almost 77 persons and 120 injured. I think that kind of criminals should be punished
                    without
                    applying
                    any rehabilitations just because their people that cannot have another chance. If not
                    rehabilitated,
                    this
                    person after leaving the prison can be very dangerous and the price of the mistake can be too
                    high.

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight" style="margin-top: 2em;"> It is also important to
                    mention that using
                    prison
                    as rehabilitation is also very expensive for the
                    society
                    and is possible only in those counties who can afford it. Norway is an oil exporter, one of the
                    biggest
                    in
                    the world and has very high taxes to provide a very good social area including rehabilitation
                    programs
                    in
                    prisons.</p> <br>
